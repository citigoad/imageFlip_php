This is a face symmetery application.

functionality:

upload an image with file extension jpg (not jpeg and does not support any other image formats).
image will be displayed when u click submit button. Place the mouse on the image and draw a line on the image some where vertically.
A new image will be displayed with flipping the first part of the image symmetrically and gives an image. Similarly the second part of the image 
will be flipped identically and returns the second image.

design:

index.php is used to submit an image and this image is redirected to the flipimage.php.
'Flipimage.php' This is a web service which accepts an image and its co ordinates and returns the symmetrical images on the same image.
This flipimage is the web service which can be used in different websites for the same functionality by passing the arguments.

future work:

this can be improved with additional image functionalities like image flipping, image effects like greyscale and with good plug ins and css we can 
develop it as a good website.
